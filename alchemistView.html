                    <p class="para">I have recently read a book named <strong>The Alchemist</strong> by <strong>Paulo
                            Coelho</strong>
                        which definitely motivates one who reads the book with heart The Book Explains
                        <em style="color: #00b0ff;">When you want
                            something,all the Universe Conspires in helping you to achieve it</em></p>
                    <p class="para"> This book is about a
                        young man who wants to become a shepherd instead of priest and he want to learn the purpose of
                        his life and also he want to know his destiny. Someone suggested him that you can learn the
                        meaning of life and you will find yourself by travelling.</p>
                    <p class="para">
                        Then he started his voyage with flocks........ and while travelling he met different kinds of
                        people(king, merchant, desert woman, alchemist). They changed his life and also he understood
                        the purpose of life, his dream, his destiny and more....
                        And finally he achieved his goal but to know how he achieved and how he learnt while travelling
                        then you have to read this book.
                    </p>
                    <h3>My words to you:</h2>
                        <p class="para">
                            Every creature on this earth has a purpose. Even you and I existed on this earth for a
                            purpose.
                            But we need to find that purpose which we call it as goal, dream, destiny.
                            And whatever you do, you need learn from that work because it may helps on a way to your
                            destiny.
                            Do you why we encounter with problems or failures?
                            Because If you learn from that experience then it may helpful in future or else if you skip
                            that
                            experience you may reach your destiny but you will be in fear of failure or you may be in
                            trouble.
                            so I suggest you to tackle the failure whenever it encounters don't skip otherwise you will
                            be
                            in trouble
                        </p>

                        <p class="end-quote" style="color: #00b0ff;"><strong>LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST WAY TO
                                SUCCESS</strong>
